### To-do list - vanilla JS

**js/todo.js  
My original code of a school assignment. I wrote this code after two months of learning in JavaScript. This assignment was to understand DOM manupulation.  
  
**js/todo2.js    
This is my re-write version of todo list. This is written with ES6 and module pattern and still Vanilla JS.
